As a Developer, I can use natural language systems to build websites quickly, so that I can automate website creation

See all [stories](./STORIES.md)


## Usage

See all [usage examples](./USAGE.md)



## Development

Checkout the repo

```bash
git clone 
```

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. 

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

```bash
bin/console

Aaa::Bbb::Program.execute()
# => ""
```

`tailwind_dsl` is setup with Guard, run `guard`, this will watch development file changes and run tests automatically, if successful, it will then run rubocop for style quality.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, build the gem and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

```bash
rake publish
rake clean
```
